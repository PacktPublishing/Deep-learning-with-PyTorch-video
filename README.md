# Deep Learning with PyTorch [Video]
This is the code repository for [Deep Learning with PyTorch [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-learning-pytorch-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788475266), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
	This video course will get you up-and-running with one of the most cutting-edge deep learning libraries: PyTorch. Written in Python, PyTorch is grabbing the attention of all data science professionals due to its ease of use over other libraries and its use of dynamic computation graphs. 

In this course, you will learn how to accomplish useful tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks to process spatial data such as images and using Recurrent Neural Networks to process sequential data such as texts. You will explore how you can make use of unlabeled data using Auto Encoders. You will also be training a neural network to learn how to balance a pole all by itself, using Reinforcement Learning. Throughout this journey, you will implement various mechanisms of the PyTorch framework to do these tasks. 

By the end of the video course, you will have developed a good understanding of, and feeling for, the algorithms and techniques used. You'll have a good knowledge of how PyTorch works and how you can use it in to solve your daily machine learning problems.
